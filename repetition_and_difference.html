            <h2>Repetition and Difference</h2>
            <br>
            "Everything reacts on everything else, and everything resembles everything else (resemblance of the diverse with itself)" (Gilles Deleuze).
            <br><br>
            Life is full of repetition, none of which are the same. Repetition and difference make up our lives. This book includes a hundred photos, which were taken in places around the world. Although they were taken in different places, resemblances can still be found among them. Based on the theme of the book, which is repetition and difference, and the feature of screen printing, which is repeating the same movements and producing different outcomes, the book was screen printed and bound by hand.
            <br><br>
            Repetition composes the world. Every difference of it makes the world more dynamic and vivid.

            According to the concept of repetition and cycles, the book was designed as a cube. It is a cube when it is closed and a circle when open.
